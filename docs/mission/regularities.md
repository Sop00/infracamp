How to deal with customer's data: 

***Companies data must be kept secret by default!***

When you want to present data based on customers behalf, you'll
have to have a written confirmation on publishing their data according
to the confirmation.

Why should they share:

- It's important to share data across companies borders.
- It's important to keep the source anonymous.

***Never ever share companies names*** in presentations (public or private)

- Don't take the company to a task! (Should be clear!)
- Don't talk about customers (only anonymisized)
- ...think twice about the rest!
