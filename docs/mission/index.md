# Our mission

***We are developers. We are independent businesses, sharing the development of our
foundations.***

Developing and maintaining highly scalable infrastructure services is 
a difficult and expensive but vital task for modern organisations. Infracamp's mission
is to provide professional exchange and collaboration on developing 
lean development-oriented services and expertise from private companies to
everyone.

We believe concepts and architecture are way more important than programming-language
and platforms. To prevent chaos, infracamp provides preconfigured best-practice 
container-setups suitable for our needs. 

Our backers provide manpower to develop open-source infrastructure services
properly designed to the needs of their businesses (instead of any businesses).

## Target group

We can't provide frameworks for everyone's needs! We focus on:

- (Micro-)Webservices powered by script-languages as Python, PHP, Ruby, JavaScript, etc)
- container landscape (docker)
- HTTP based APIs
- massive hardware-scalability (1 - >100k CPU Cores)
- scalable agile team setups (including newbies)
- continuous deployment / fail fast
- code b4 configuration

Our belief: Secretiveness won't lead to success; collaboration and
know-how transfer does.

Maybe you'll be featured if you'll do:

- Machine Learning
- KI
- Big data warehousing

## Mission-statement

Imfracamp is an organisation to let your employees become developers.

- Infracamp is
    - Language-agnostic: We have containers for Python, PHP, NodeJS, Jekyll
      Develop your own, if you want to.
    - OS-agnostic: Supports Linux, MacOS and Windows
    - Platform-agnostic: AWS, GCS, Azure, Bare-Metal
    - Framework-agnostic: It's your turn
    - Open-Source-agnostic: MIT-licenced (Closed source if you want to)

We want to
- Collect best practice of companies doing webservices
- Provide foundation-services for scalable companies and organisations
     

Infracamp's goals:

- Supported by companies, powered by developers. 
- Vendor-agnostic: Infrastructure services run on Amazon, Google, Azure, any other hoster, 
  even Bare-Metal
- Shiftable: Google is billing you too much? Your Amazon free tier is over. Azure
  is too slow? We want to benefit from the best cloud-services available. And
  want to shift to better ones, as they come. Supported by infracamp's abstraction
  libraries
- Developer-centric: Developers should use their private github/gitlab accounts so their
  ideas count for their CV too.
- There is only better: We want to discuss and try different approaches. In development
  there is no right way. There is only a better way.
- Teachable: 
    - Small footprint.
    - Separate usability.
    - A small, non redundant and meaningful documentation is the most difficult task
        - For professionals
        - And for students


## Why do companies join infracamp?

Even if you have the best concept on doing one thing - you might miss another. Infracamp's
main effort is boosting the exchange between developers and their ideas. We want to provide
a friendly and open community to discuss and try out controversial concepts.

It's your employees ideas. And they can (hopefully will) contribute to it even if they leave
your company. It might sound wired, but this is the only way to keep the knowledge of a leaving
colleague inside the company: Mainly because you'll won't find a developer maintaining some other ones ideas.

Furthermore: Infracamp is independent, so developers might be engaged to provide 
their spare-work projects. These projects might power your business for years.

Because all infracamp's projects are MIT licenced, you can make a copy and maintain the work
done on your own. (Feel free to do so with any of our projects)

## Why do developers engage in infracamp? 

It's your project. Not your's companies one. Even if you change your company or get
self-employed: you'll keep your personal work and benefit from the work of other contributors.

List contributions in your CV or hold a talk about it in a conference. It's MIT licenced. 



## Technical goals

- Less credentials: 
    - No credentials in repositories
    - Automatic rotation of application credentials
    - Encrypted credentials in repositories where needed
- Develop on your workstation
- Test on your workstation
- Automate everything you did more than twice
- Less waiting
