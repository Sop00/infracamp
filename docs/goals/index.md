# Goals of infracamp.org

Imfracamp is an organisation to let your employees become developers.

- Infracamp is
    - Language-agnostic: We have containers for Python, PHP, NodeJS, Jekyll
      Develop your own, if you want to.
    - OS-agnostic: Supports Linux, MacOS and Windows
    - Platform-agnostic: AWS, GCS, Azure, Bare-Metal
    - Framework-agnostic: It's your turn
    - Open-Source: 

We want to
    - Collect best practice of companies doing webservices
    - Provide foundation-services for scalable companies and organisations
     

Infracamp's goals:

- Supported by companies, powered by developers. 
- Vendor-agnostic: Infrastructure should run on Amazon, Google, Azure, any other hoster, 
  even Bare-Metal
- Shiftable: Google is billing you too much? Your Amazon free tier is over. Azure
  is too slow? We want to benefit from the best cloud-services available. And
  want to shift to better ones, as they come. Supported by infracamp's abstraction
  libraries
- Developer-centric: Developers should use their private github/gitlab accounts so their
  ideas count for their CV too.
- There is only better: We want to discuss and try different approaches. In development
  there is not the right way. There is only a better way.
- Teachable: 
    - Small footprint.
    - Separate usability.
    - A small, non redundant and meaningful documentation is the most difficult task
        - For professionals
        - And for students


## Technical goals

- Less credentials: 
    - No credentials in repositories
    - Automatic rotation of application credentials
    - Encrypted credentials in repositories where needed
- Develop on your workstation
- Test on your workstation
- Automate everything you did more than twice
- Less waiting
